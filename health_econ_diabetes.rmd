This project evaluates whether implementing a preventive Type 2 Diabetes screening program in Nairobi is cost-effective compared to treating diabetes after diagnosis. The analysis uses simulated data based on public health cost assumptions.
set.seed(2025)
population_size <- 1000

cost_A <- rnorm(population_size, mean = 1500, sd = 500)  # No screening
qaly_A <- rnorm(population_size, mean = 5, sd = 1)

cost_B <- rnorm(population_size, mean = 1200, sd = 400)  # With screening
qaly_B <- rnorm(population_size, mean = 6, sd = 1)

health_data <- data.frame(
  cost_A = cost_A,
  qaly_A = qaly_A,
  cost_B = cost_B,
  qaly_B = qaly_B
)

head(health_data)
cer_A <- mean(health_data$cost_A) / mean(health_data$qaly_A)
cer_B <- mean(health_data$cost_B) / mean(health_data$qaly_B)

incremental_cost <- mean(health_data$cost_B) - mean(health_data$cost_A)
incremental_qaly <- mean(health_data$qaly_B) - mean(health_data$qaly_A)
icer <- incremental_cost / incremental_qaly

data.frame(
  CER_No_Screening = cer_A,
  CER_Screening = cer_B,
  ICER = icer
)

CER (Cost-Effectiveness Ratio): Measures the cost per QALY in each scenario.

ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio): Compares the additional cost per extra QALY gained by screening.

If the ICER is below the threshold (e.g., 3x GDP per capita, approx. KSh 360,000), then the screening is cost-effective.
This simplified simulation suggests that preventive screening for diabetes may improve health outcomes at a lower cost, thus being a potentially cost-effective intervention. Future work should include real data from MoH or NHIF, and more robust models (Markov, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, etc).
