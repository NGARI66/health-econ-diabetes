# ðŸ©º Health Economics Project: Cost-Effectiveness of Diabetes Screening in Nairobi

This project explores whether **preventive screening for Type 2 Diabetes** in Nairobi is a **cost-effective intervention** compared to treating diagnosed patients. It uses simulated data and simplified cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) principles.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Simulate a basic health economics scenario
- Calculate and compare **Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (CER)** and the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**
- Visualize cost vs. health outcomes
- Practice sharing reproducible R-based analysis

---

## ðŸ“Š Methods

- Analysis done using **R** and **R Markdown**
- Simulated data on:
  - Cost per patient for Screening (B) vs No Screening (A)
  - Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained
- ICER calculated as:
  
  \[
  ICER = \frac{\text{Cost}_{B} - \text{Cost}_{A}}{\text{QALY}_{B} - \text{QALY}_{A}}
  \]
